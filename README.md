## Why Data Science?
Since I started as a finance/accounting professional, I always look for projects which allow me to identify “efficiency”, be it process improvement that saves labor hours, or bundling purchases to save money. I like finding the “optimal” solution for problems. After 5 years in the field, I transitioned into supply chain/inventory planning, which presents limitless opportunities on finding efficiencies. Soon enough I hit the bottleneck on tools that I need to solve those complex problems.

This is the moment when the concept of machine learning being introduced to me, which allows me to use programming languages to solve multivariable problems, leveraging proven algorithms to simulate results. I see this as the Swiss Army knife of hacking problems in almost any business problem that I am facing every day. I decided, at that point, to commit to this field as my long term career path.

   - **Objective**: Predict the likelihood of paid off for loans based on information provided by borrowers at the point of application. The model should be able to screen out high risk loan requests and not rejecting good loans request by mistake. 
   - The metric used for evaluating models will be F1 score. In this study, target 0 = default, target 1 = paid off.
   - Model applied : Logistics Regression, Random Forecast.

   - **Objective**: Given 34 months of sales history (Jan 2013 – Oct 2015) of a gaming retailer by items and by shops, predict sales for Nov 2015 (period 35)
   - The metric used for evaluating models will be rmse.
   - Models applied: ARMA, SARIMA, Holt Winter, Prophet, VARMAX, Xgboost, Random Forest, Rigde
