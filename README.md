## Why Data Science?
I always look for projects which allow me to identify “efficiency,” be it process improvement that saves labor hours, or forecasting spending decision to save money. I enjoy seeking the “optimal” solution for problems.
<br>
We are exposed to a massive volume of data like never before; the opportunity of finding efficiency becomes limitless. Data Science is an excellent tool to comb through layers of data to identify the “golden eggs” within. Thanks to user-friendly programming languages like Python, I can combine my business experience and be self-sufficient in tackling problems with Big Data.
